    The add-on comes with a card model that can be used to add the
    readings as described on the <a href="/pinyin.html">pinyin</a>
    page.
    <h3>Adding the model</h3>
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/add note type.png"
	   alt="Click here, here, here, here, here and here." />
      <figcaption>Click here, here, here, here, here and here.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    The Chinese model is added as a standard model, so that a copy of
    it can be always added as a new model.
    <p>While this is a standard process, it still requires a number of
    clicks to get to the right dialog window. One way works like this:
    <ul>
      <li>Click on Add in the top bar to open the Add note window,
      <li>There, click on the note type at the top,
      <li>at Choose Note Type, on Manage,
      <li>at Note Type, on Add.
      <li>At Add Note Type, select Add: Chinese and click on OK.
      <li>Then, make sure that the name you select contains the word
      “Chinese”. This is used as a code word later.
      <li>Close the Note Types.
      <li>And at Choose Note Type, choose the newly createtd Chinese
      type and click on Choose.
    </ul>
    <p>You have to go through these steps only <span class="qtbase"
    id="once">once</span>. After that, you
    have the note type ready. When you want to add more cards and you
    click on Add, either the type is already selected or you click on
    the note type, click on Chinese and on Choose.
    <h3>The note type – Help</h3>
    The note type is a quick hack. It uses a <em>Japanese</em> font
    for displaying the Chinese text. The reason is simple: i don’t
    know which Chinese fonts can be safely used as standard. Which
    Chinese fonts are installed with basic Chinese support on
    different operating systems.
    <p>In general, the whole model is more a proof of concept and a
    way to test the reading generation than a deck that is useful for
    learning Chinese.
    <p>To fix this, i need help. Just sending me a nicely formated
    Anki 2 deck that is used to actually learn Chinese would be a
    help. I don’t need thousands of Chinese words, so reducing it to a
    few notes would be a nice gesture.
    <p>The ideal way would be to fork the whole repository, write it
    up as a standard model in the file
    <a href="https://github.com/ospalh/chinese-support-addon/blob/master/chinese/model.py"><tt>model.py</tt></a>
    and set a pull request. Or even better yet, take over the whole
    development.
    <h3>Updates</h3>

    When the model has changed with an update of the add-on, you will
    have to add the model again, going through the steps
    above. Depending on the changes, you may want to change the note
    type of your existing cards, so that they use the new model. When
    you have customized your old model, you will have to decide what
    to do about the changes introduced in the update: ignore them,
    make similar changes to your model, or move your cards to the new
    model and re-customize that model.
